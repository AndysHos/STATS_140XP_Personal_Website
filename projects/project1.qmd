This project investigates air quality in Seoul, focusing on the Nowon-gu district, using data from AirKorea, a South Korean company specializing in air pollution monitoring. The study specifically examines PM2.5 and PM10 levels, which are critical indicators of air pollution that can significantly impact respiratory health. Data spanning from January 2015 to January 2022 was analyzed on a monthly basis to understand trends and variations in air quality. The study aims to determine the patterns of particulate matter concentration and provide insights into how air pollution fluctuates over time, particularly in highly populated areas like Nowon-gu.

To analyze the data, the project employs time-series modeling and decomposition techniques. Various statistical models, including linear and nonlinear approaches, were tested to determine the best fit for forecasting future pollution levels. The study assesses the stationarity of the data through autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation functions (ACF and PACF), revealing that PM2.5 levels exhibit periodic fluctuations rather than a linear trend. The project finds that a nonlinear model using multiplicative decomposition captures seasonal variations more effectively than an additive approach. Winter months show higher PM2.5 concentrations, while summer months, especially August, exhibit lower pollution levels.

The forecasting component extends the analysis by predicting future air quality trends for the next 12 months, incorporating seasonal adjustments. While the selected model performs well, residual analysis suggests that additional refinements could improve prediction accuracy, such as accounting for longer-term cycles or expanding the dataset. Future work could enhance the model by integrating more historical data or employing advanced machine learning techniques to refine predictions. The study underscores the importance of continuous air quality monitoring to inform policy decisions aimed at reducing pollution and mitigating health risks for residents in Seoul.
