The project focuses on classification modeling to predict the winner of the 2020 U.S. Presidential Election based on demographic data from 3,111 counties. The dataset includes key predictors such as median age, Cuban population, urbanization levels, Asian population, and educational attainment. Exploratory data analysis revealed notable trends, including a higher median age for Trump voters, stronger support for Biden in urban areas, and higher levels of education correlating with Bidenâ€™s victories. Data preprocessing steps included normalizing numeric predictors, encoding categorical variables into dummy variables, addressing multicollinearity by removing highly correlated features, and imputing missing values using median imputation.

Multiple classification models were tested, including decision trees, logistic regression, and random forests. Each model underwent hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation to optimize accuracy. The decision tree models provided interpretability but had lower accuracy. Logistic regression models were simple and efficient but lacked flexibility in handling complex relationships. The random forest model, implemented using the "ranger" engine, outperformed the others with an accuracy of approximately 90.7%. This model leveraged multiple decision trees to enhance predictive power while mitigating overfitting. Logarithmic transformations were applied to right-skewed features, and interaction terms were explored to capture deeper relationships within the data.

The final model selection favored the random forest approach due to its superior performance in handling large, complex datasets.
