This project explores different methods for simulating heat diffusion in a two-dimensional space using Python. Heat diffusion is modeled using the heat equation, which describes how temperature spreads over time. The study utilizes matrix-based approaches to compute temperature updates at each grid point, incorporating finite difference methods. The primary goal is to compare the computational efficiency and accuracy of various implementations, including traditional matrix multiplication, sparse matrix representations, and high-performance computing techniques. Visualization through heatmaps allows for an intuitive understanding of how temperature propagates through the simulated environment.

Four different methods are tested: matrix multiplication, sparse matrix operations using JAX, direct computation using NumPy, and JAX’s just-in-time (JIT) compiled approach. The standard matrix multiplication method provides a baseline but is computationally expensive, taking approximately 95 seconds for a given simulation. The sparse matrix method with JAX improves efficiency significantly, reducing execution time to around 7.66 seconds. The NumPy implementation, leveraging array-based operations, further accelerates performance to 0.74 seconds. Finally, the JAX JIT-compiled approach is the fastest, reducing computation time to approximately 0.44 seconds, nearly twice as fast as the NumPy method. The study highlights how different numerical techniques and hardware acceleration can drastically enhance performance in large-scale simulations.

The findings suggest that JAX’s JIT compilation is the most efficient method for heat diffusion simulations, making it an optimal choice for large-scale computational tasks. While NumPy provides a simple and efficient approach, JAX offers better scalability and performance for repeated simulations. Sparse matrix operations also prove beneficial, particularly in reducing unnecessary computations in large grid-based models.
